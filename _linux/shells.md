# Linux Shells

A shell is a command line interpreter that is the most commonly used method to run programs on a linux host.
When you use `ssh` to connect to a remote server, most of the time you will execute a shell on the remote server.
A shell will give you a prompt and wait for commands. Prompts can be customized, but the common ubuntu prompt looks like this:
```bash
bmcgough@rhino3:~/github/FredHutch$ 
```
As you can see, this is in the format `<username>@<hostname>:<CWD>$`.
